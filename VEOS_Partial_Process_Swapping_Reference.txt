VEOS Partial Process Swapping Reference
Date:January-2020

1 Introduction
The Partial Process Swapping function (PPS) provides the function that save 
and restore the VE memory of suspended VE process.
Releases VE memory by saving a part of the memory of one or more temporarily 
stopped VE processes to VH side memory (swap out). Another program can use the 
released VE memory. After the new program finished, restore the memory saved in
the VH memory to the VE memory (swap in), and the execution of the original 
program can be resumed.

1.1 Term definition
This chapter defines the terms used in this document.
1) PPS buffer: The saving destination (buffer on VH) when saving VE memory to 
   VH memory.
2) swap out: Saves a part of the memory of VE processes to PPS buffer, and 
   release VE memory.
3) swap in: Restores the memory saved in PPS buffer to VE memory, and the 
   execution of program can be resumed.
4) status: Indicates the execution state of the VE process. The status is 
   displayed with the same symbol as the "ps" command.
5) sub-status: Indicates the state of the VE process.
   It is a PPS original definition to indicate the progress of 
   swap out/swap in processing.
   The definition of each sub status is as follows.
   a     swap out is not performed, the same as conventional stop state
   o     swap out is processing
   s     swap out is finished
   i     swap in is processing

2 Preset
This chapter describes the settings required to use the Partial Process 
Swapping function.

2.1 About HugePages of VH
PPS buffer uses HugePages. To change the number of HugePages, execute following 
command.
------
$ sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=<the number of VH's HugePages>
------
The size of one HugePages is 2MB. 
If you want to allocate 40GB buffer, you should specify "20480" to above " the
number of VH's HugePages".
Please see more details in "SX-Aurora TSUBASA Installation Guide".

2.2 About veswap.options
You can set per VE node to the maximum size of memory that can be swapped out.

- When setting a common value for all VE nodes
/etc/opt/nec/ve/veos/ve-os-launcher.d/veswap.options
- When setting each VE node individually
/etc/opt/nec/ve/veos/ve-os-launcher.d/<N>/veswap.options
<N> is VE node number

Please modify "veswap.options" as follows.
------
#The maximum size of memory that can be swapped out per VE node.
ve-os-launcher@*=--ve-swap-mem-max=<size(MB unit)>
------

Then, please restart VEOS as follows.
------
$ systemctl restart ve-os-launcher@<N>
------
<N> is VE node number

2) Details of options
-o                        Swaps out the VE memory of specified VE process to 
                          PPS buffer.
                          VE memory whose status is "T" and whose sub-status 
                          is "a" is able to swap out.
-i                        Swaps in the VE memory of specified VE process from 
                          PPS buffer.
                          VE memory whose status is "T" and whose sub-status
                          is "s" is able to swap in.
-m                        Displays the VE memory size information of the 
                          specified VE processes.
                          Displays the size of swappable VE memory (SWAPPABLE) 
                          and the size of VE memory swapped out (SWAPPED).
-s                        Displays the swapped out VE memory size in VE units.
-H                        Not display the header.
-h, --help                Displays the help and exit.
-V, --version             Displays version information and exit.

3) Details of parameters
pid                       Specifies the ID of VE process.

4 Example of using
This chapter shows an example of swapping out the VE memory of the process
(VE process A) of VE program A and executing the VE program B.
"Pid-A" in the example is the process ID of the process(VE process A) of 
VE program A.
-----
1) Stop the VE process A with "SIGSTOP".
  $ kill -s SIGSTOP pid-A

2) Make sure that the status(S) of the VE process A is "T", and the sub-status
  (SUB-S) of the VE process A is "a".
  $ /opt/nec/ve/bin/veswap pid-A
  S   SUB-S     PID
  T     a      pid-A

3) Swap out the VE memory after the status(S) of the VE process A becomes "T"
   and the sub-status(SUB-S) of VE becomes "a".
  $ /opt/nec/ve/bin/veswap -o pid-A

4) Make sure that the status(S) of the VE process A is "T", and the sub-status
  (SUB-S) of the VE process A is "s".
  $ /opt/nec/ve/bin/veswap pid-A
  S   SUB-S     PID
  T     s      pid-A

5) After the status(S) of the VE process A becomes "T" and the sub-status
   (SUB-S) of the VE process A becomes "s", Please check the free VE memory 
   size.
   Supplement:If there is not enough free VE memory for executing the VE 
   program, please release more memories.
  $ /opt/nec/ve/bin/free

6) Execute the VE program B with the same executing method as executing a 
   normal VE program.

7) Wait for the completion of the VE program B.

8) Swap in the saved VE memory of the VE process A.
  $ /opt/nec/ve/bin/veswap -i pid-A

9) Make sure that the status(S) of the VE process A is "T", and the sub-status
  (SUB-S) of the VE process A is "a".
  When this status(S) and sub-status(SUB-S) is reached, the swapped out VE 
  memory is swapped in, and the VE process A has returned to the state before
  swapping out the VE memory.
  $ /opt/nec/ve/bin/veswap pid-A
  S   SUB-S     PID
  T     a      pid-A

10) Resume the VE process A with "SIGCONT".
  $ kill -s SIGCONT pid-A
-----

5 Precautions
1) In the swap in, if the processing cannot be continued due to lack of VE 
   memory, the swap in processing will wait until the VE memory is released.
   As a result, the swap in process may take more time than expected. 
   swap out/swap in requests are not processed in parallel and are 
   processed one by one, so the start of subsequent swap out/swap in is 
   also delayed.
